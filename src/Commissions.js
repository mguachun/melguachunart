                <h1>Commission General Terms</h1>
                    <h2>By commissioning me, you are agreeing to the terms of service.</h2>
                    <h2>I. General Terms</h2>
                        <h3>Contact me through email (via contact page or melguachunart@gmail.com) detailing your concept or idea. 
                        Please include the following necessary specifications such as size, colors, 
                        number of pieces, deadlines, etc. Provide neat references if possible.
                        Commission completion can take anywhere from one to two weeks. (It will very likely be faster than that, 
                        but I give myself extra time as a precaution).</h3>
            </p>
            <p>
                <h2>II. Payment</h2>
                    <h3>Do not send payment until ALL details have been discussed and you, the commissioner, have been given 
                the approval by me, the artist to do so. Commissions must pay a 50% deposit upfront. Commission will only 
                be started once the 50% deposit is received. The other 50% of the deposit should be given once the commission is 
                complete and delivered to the commissioner.</h3>
                    <h3>Payment can be made through PayPal or Venmo.</h3>
                    <h3>If using PayPal, please use only the "goods /services" option when sending payment. Select as "service/no address required". Do NOT send using the "family/friends/gifts" option. 
                Invoices may be used in the future by the artist.</h3>
                    <h3>Only USD accepted.</h3>
            
            </p>
            <p>
                <h2>III. Customer Satisfaction</h2>
                <h3>Work in Progress updates will be delivered periodically to ensure the satisfaction of the commissioner. 
                    WIP's might be given if I, the artist, have any confusion about the commission. Please respond accordingly 
                    to such updates to maintain the deadline of the commission.</h3>
                    <h3>After a commission is finished, only small changes are permitted such as small coloring/marking mistakes. Any great changes such as outfit change, entire color pallet revisions, 
                        new pose/design, etc will come with an extra charge.</h3>
                        <h3>Please be clear with your concept to receive the most visually accurate commission. Do not edit your commission in anyway after it has been completed and delivered unless it has 
                            been approved by the artist.</h3>

                <h3>I have the right to cancel and refund the money for your commission at any time. (This is highly unlikely,

                    the commissioner has the right to cancel the commission. The commissioner has no right to cancel of demand a refund
                     from the artist under any circumstances after payment has been received.</h3>
